  <h1>Orlando 2013</h1>
  <div class="date"> May 2013</div>

  <p>Orlando 2013 was the first trip I went on with friends. Jenny, Matthew, and I decided to head to Orlando to hit up the theme parks for our graduation trip. Having been to Disneyworld in December of 2012, I was still very familiar with the Disney parks and was ecstatic to head back for a second time. </p>
  <p>Having just paid off our student debt, we knew that this was going to be a budget trip. We chose a time of year that was off-season, chose the most inexpensive hotel, decided to order our own groceries(which was quite an experience), and decided on the most budget friendly travel options. All in all, I think we did fairly well at just around a grand per person. </p>
  <p>Disneyworld in the spring/summer was an entirely new experience. That, along with being with two of my closest friends, made it a very memorable graduation trip.</p>
