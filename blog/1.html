      <h1>Update</h1>
      <div class="date">March 19, 2020</div>

      <p>Reading and writing used to come easily to me and was something I made time for, but for the past few years, I feel like I’ve lost my creative outlet.  Somewhere between adopting Lilo and Skip, moving in with Dan downtown, and the hustle and bustle of work, I chose to put aside this passion of mine.</p>

      <p>I can’t exactly pinpoint why, but I feel like it started to do with the move downtown. When I lived with my parents, everything was quiet, serene, and I could hear myself think. I had time to be with myself and do all that I wanted to do. I would read endlessly and get lost in a world that was not my own; I would write and reflect. I would learn new words and apply them to my daily life. Looking back, perhaps I was in a bubble of ignorance that popped with the changes of life. I was naive; and now I am less so.</p>

      <p>Fast forward a few years, to me sitting on the floor of my now condo. I have responsibilities now that I didn’t have then and there. I am a mom to two dogs whom I love with all my heart, albeit annoying at times. Work comes with feelings of love, frustration and above all, stress that is inevitable in every person’s work life. Daily chores add up and become a nuisance that must be tackled. I’ve slowly lost touch with those that I don’t make time for, but it hasn’t bothered me as much as I thought it would. The more that happens, the more I found myself overwhelmed.</p>

      <p>As I write this, I have come to the realization that in these past few years, I became an adult and didn’t even notice.</p>

      <p>So it is time to ground myself again. I will dedicate time every so often to myself and open up that part of me once more. It is imperative to my mental health that I make an effort to do what I love, and that is this.</p>
