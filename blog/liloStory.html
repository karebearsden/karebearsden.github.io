      <h1>Lilo's Story</h1>
      <div class="date">March 25, 2020</div>

      <p> Lilo’s story started long before her adoption date. When I graduated from undergrad, I went on to work in a Veterinary clinic as an assistant and would dog-sit on the side for clients; One of these clients had two golden retrievers. I would go to their home twice a week to spend time with their dogs for a few hours, give them a walk, and be paid 50$ for the day. They were such good friends and the idea of having two dogs as companions stuck with me since then.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to 2018. Skip had settled in quite well and I was dog-sitting for friends here and there whenever they went away. With every dog that came to stay with us, we noticed that Skip was quite tolerant towards them. While he did not pay much attention to them and kept to himself, I slowly entertained the idea of getting a companion for him. Dan thought otherwise.</p>
      <p>At first, He downright refused to consider the thought of adopting a second dog. Thoughts of, “It would be so much extra work”, or “It would be double the amount in finances”. I knew that he was being logical, and so I would push the thought of out of my mind. However, it would never leave and would just linger. </p>
      <p>In late 2018, we saw more and more of our neighbour Will. He had adopted two dogs from an organization called Free Korean Dogs and was also a director of the volunteer organization. I had told him one day that I would love to get Skip a companion, and he told me to look up the organization when we were ready because he would be able to help find us a pup. </p>
      <p>Free Korean Dogs is an organization that rescues dogs from South Korea (mainly from the meat trade) and sends them to families in Toronto and Vancouver. I had to admit, most of their dogs seemed so loveable and beautiful. They also put extra time and effort into training their dogs to be adoptable and had good core values. I would browse their site every so often, which turned into once a week, and slowly but surely, turned into daily.</p>
      <p>By 2019, I was on the site every single day and would bring up the topic of adopting a second dog more often. Dan seemed to be more open to the idea, and so we started to talk about the logistics. We comprised a list of a dog we were looking for:</p>
      <p>- Smaller size (condo appropriate)</p>
      <p>- Medium energy (we wanted an actual dog - not a cat like Skip)</p>
      <p>- A dog that doesn’t shed as much</p>
      <p>- Young (less than 2 years old)</p>
      <p>- dog friendly personality </p>
      <p>And so, I started to look. We applied to 3-4 dogs but was found to be not the best fit for them. It was discouraging, but I kept looking every single day. I knew that Free Korean Dogs updated their adoptable list quite often, so I found myself refreshing their site multiple times a day. I was obsessed. </p>
      <p>I can remember the moment I saw Lilo’s profile pop up on Free Korean Dogs. I was sitting in bed one night, just about to head to bed, when I decided to refresh the FKD page and lo and behold, Lilo’s little face popped up. I always had a soft spot for the brindle pattern in dogs, so I clicked on her profile right away. To my excitement, her profile stated that the ideal family would be someone who wanted a friendly and loveable dog, but would also understand that she needed time and socialization training. I quickly showed Dan, who was indifferent due to the rejections from our other applications, and applied for her right away. Within the hour, we received an email from an adoption coordinator saying they wanted to move forward with our application. </p>
      <p>Lilo (FKD Ciny) had to come to Canada within a week since her foster family in Korea were planning to move. Though it was a bit rushed on our end, we adjusted our work schedules and got our home ready for her arrival. I wasn’t able to meet her at the airport the morning of her flight, but Dan went to pick her up from Pearson. He said she was scared and anxious the whole drive home, and was still nervous when I got home that afternoon to meet her. Within an hour of settling in, she was already playing with Skip. Admittedly, Skip wasn’t the least bit interested in getting to know her. He probably saw her as another dog that was staying with us for a while. </p>
      <p>For the next few weeks, Dan and I found ourselves going through the ups and downs of settling her in. Among the separation anxiety, her shedding, barking, chewing, bad leash walking, we slowly but surely taught her the rules of our home and how to be around Skip. </p>
      <p>Fast forward to March 2020 today, I can say that she still has little mannerisms we need to work on, but she has captured our hearts entirely. Once she opens her heart to someone, she is beyond loyal, loveable and friendly. All she wants to do is to be with us, will always listen to our direction, and is so quick to pick up on training.</p>
      <p>Though her and Skip aren’t necessarily the best of friends, I can see that they respect each other. Lilo looks to Skip during times she’s nervous and Skip picks up little quirks from Lilo, and to me, that’s a great start. My hope for them is that they one day become companions and look to each other for guidance. I look forward to the rest of my life with these two babies of mine. </p>
